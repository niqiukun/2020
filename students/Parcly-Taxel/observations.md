### Project: MarkBind

Essentially "Markdown plus", MarkBind is a tool to generate dynamic websites using a Markdown-like syntax. It supports tooltips, icons, search, navigation and more.

### My Contributions

I submitted [pull request #1035](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/1035) to fix [issue #1001](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1001).

### My Observations

This is an NUS-OSS project that functions much like other projects out in the open.

* Pull requests need at least one approval (review) before merging.
* There is a set template that appears when making a new pull request, detailing fields that ideally should be filled in before submitting.
