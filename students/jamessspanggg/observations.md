### Project: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org)

OpenRefine (previously known as Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data. The tool is capable of cleaning data, transforming it from one format into another, and extending it with web services and external data.

The server-side of OpenRefine is implemented in Java as a single servlet which is executed by the [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/) web server + servlet container. The client-side is implemented in HTML, CSS, Javascript and libraries such as [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Recurser jquery-i18n](https://github.com/recurser/jquery-i18n).

### My Contributions

The following are my merged PRs for OpenRefine:
1. [Translate Sort link to the language of the UI](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2275)
2. [Standardise 'edit' cell dialogue with 'toNumber()' when parsing String to Number](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2274)
3. [[#2220] Add facet for blank values/records per column](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2297)
4. [[#2280] Add fill down and blank down operations for all columns](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2296)

My contributions for the project starts off with mainly bug fixes (PR 1 & 2) to ease my understanding to the large existing codebase. After having a deeper understanding of the existing codebase, I added some new features (PR 3 and 4) that provide more value and simplifies the effort of the user.

### My Observations

OpenRefine is available in more than 15 languages. So whenever adding a new feature involves displaying texts, the corresponding translation for the other languages should also be added.
