### Project: Hugo

Hugo is a widely used static site generator written in Go, with over 40.7k stars on Github.

### My Contributions

Added support for raw string literals to be used in the shortcode params. Link to PR [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/6753/)

### My Observations

The lexer was based on a talk by Rob Pike and is quite interesting.
